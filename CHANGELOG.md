# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- API reference skills (GitLab, GitHub, Gitea) — added Pagination section with host-specific loop patterns and pagination-required warnings on `GET_CR_DISCUSSIONS`, `GET_CR_COMMENTS`, and `GET_CR_DIFF` operations. Previously agents silently dropped results beyond the first page.
- development skill Phase 6 and code-review skill Phase 1/2 — added explicit pagination instructions when fetching discussions, comments, and diffs to prevent incomplete data

## [1.2.1] - 2026-03-27

### Added

- `docs/troubleshooting/ralph-loop-hook-permission-denied.md` — troubleshooting guide for the ralph-loop stop hook "Permission denied" error (root cause, mitigation, and reinstall caveat)

## [1.2.0] - 2026-03-26

### Added

- `shared/memory-cache.md` — new shared file defining the memory-based caching protocol for all `.claude/project-config/` files. Specifies cache entry naming, entry format, read-through protocol (with `pw-version` stamp comparison for automatic invalidation), write protocol, graceful fallback, and per-skill caching table.
- Memory-cache read-through protocol applied in `shared/environment-setup.md` (for `PROJECT.md`), `skills/code-review/SKILL.md` (for `REVIEW-CRITERIA.md`), `skills/testing-static/SKILL.md` (for `TEST-MATRIX.md`), and `skills/testing-prd/SKILL.md` (for `TEST-MATRIX.md` and `PRD-MANIFEST.md`) — skills check project memory before reading config files from disk, skipping the full read on cache hits.
- Memory cache write instructions added to `skills/init/SKILL.md` — after generating or updating any config file, `init` immediately writes/overwrites the corresponding memory entry so subsequent invocations get an immediate cache hit.
- Memory-cache check instructions added to all 7 sub-agent prompt files (`code-exploration`, `bug-fix`, `implementation`, `review-feedback`, `test-writing`, `initial-review`, `re-review`) — sub-agents check project memory for `project-config-PROJECT` before reading it from disk.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-03-26

### Added

- `shared/environment-setup.md`, `shared/trunk-branch.md`, `shared/api-dispatch.md` — shared partials replacing duplicated environment-setup, trunk-branch, and API-dispatch blocks across all 5 action skills
- `shared/testing-error-handling.md`, `shared/testing-phases.md`, `shared/testing-templates.md` — shared partials replacing duplicated Phase 3/4 workflow, error-handling table, and Bug Report/CR Description templates across both testing skills
- `shared/sub-agents/code-exploration.md` — parameterized consolidation of `skills/development/sub-agents/code-exploration.md` and `skills/issue-creation/sub-agents/code-exploration.md`; `{purpose}` placeholder (`"design"` or `"issue-context"`) switches the output schema

### Changed

- All 5 action skills (`development`, `code-review`, `issue-creation`, `testing-static`, `testing-prd`) updated to reference shared partials via `Read ../../shared/{file}.md` instead of embedding duplicate content inline
- `skills/gitlab-api/SKILL.md`, `skills/github-api/SKILL.md`, `skills/gitea-api/SKILL.md` — redundant standalone endpoint code blocks removed from all operations (curl examples already contain the endpoint URL)

### Removed

- `skills/development/sub-agents/code-exploration.md` — replaced by `shared/sub-agents/code-exploration.md`
- `skills/issue-creation/sub-agents/code-exploration.md` — replaced by `shared/sub-agents/code-exploration.md`

### Fixed

- GitHub Release creation now works correctly after auto-tag pushes: `auto-tag.yml` inlines the full release process (`gh release create`) directly after pushing the version tag, working around the GitHub Actions restriction that prevents `GITHUB_TOKEN` tag pushes from triggering downstream workflows. `release.yml` has been removed as it was unreachable via the normal release path and risked creating duplicate releases on manual tag pushes.

## [1.0.4] - 2026-03-26

### Added

- `docs/contributing/releasing.md` — new dedicated contributor guide covering prerequisites, Phase 1/2 bump workflow, MR-based release steps, and troubleshooting
- `development` skill — Phase 3 worktree setup now resolves the agent's git identity from the repository host API (`GET /user`) and sets `user.name` / `user.email` scoped to the worktree; remote URL is rewritten to embed the agent's token (`oauth2:<TOKEN>@<host>`) so `git push` authenticates without system credential helpers. Branches on host type (GitLab, GitHub, Gitea) with the correct auth header and API endpoint per host. Phase 4 and Phase 6 push steps updated to note that the authenticated remote is already configured.

### Changed

- Release workflow now uses CI-automated tag creation (`auto-tag` job on both GitLab CI and GitHub Actions) instead of `git push origin main --tags`; maintainers open a release MR and CI creates the tag on both hosts on merge
- `bump-version.sh` Phase 2 no longer creates a local git tag; printed instructions updated to reflect MR-first workflow
- `README.md` "Creating a release" section replaced with a pointer to `docs/contributing/releasing.md`

## [1.0.3] - 2026-03-25

### Changed

- Enforced correct token usage across all skills: `code-review` now explicitly uses `REVIEW_TOKEN_ENV_VAR` with `API_TOKEN_ENV_VAR` fallback; all `*-api` reference skills clarify token selection per calling skill; all action skills explicitly forbid use of project-owner credentials

## [1.0.2] - 2026-03-25

### Added

- Release jobs (GitLab CI and GitHub Actions) now build and upload a `project-workflows-vX.Y.Z.tar.gz` plugin archive as a downloadable release asset; GitLab uses the Generic Package Registry, GitHub uses `softprops/action-gh-release`
- New `smoke-test` CI job (GitLab and GitHub Actions) runs `.ci/smoke-test.sh` to verify structural integrity of all skill files, sub-agent files, and cross-references on every skill/shared file change
- `README.md` now documents how to update an installed plugin (both git-URL and pinned-version workflows)
- Both release pipelines now guard against empty release notes with an explicit file-size check after CHANGELOG extraction

### Changed

- `bump-version.sh` split into two phases: Phase 1 bumps `plugin.json` and prepends a CHANGELOG template (no commit); Phase 2 (`--commit <version>`) validates no unfilled placeholder lines remain before committing and tagging
- GitLab and GitHub release jobs now source release notes from `CHANGELOG.md` via `awk` (GitHub previously used auto-generated notes from PR titles)
- `bump-version.sh` version-reading logic extracted into a `read_plugin_version()` helper to eliminate duplication between phases

## [1.0.1] - 2026-03-25

### Added

- `init` skill now features an interactive interview mode — instead of copying template files full of placeholders, it walks the user through grouped question phases and generates populated config files from their answers
- `init` skill now supports **update mode** — re-running `/project-workflows:init` on an already-configured project shows a status dashboard and lets the user update individual sections, add new repositories, or configure skills they previously skipped
- `init` skill detects legacy (non-interactive) config files and offers to replace or update them
- Config files generated by the interactive init now include a `<!-- pw-version: 1.0.1 -->` stamp on the first line, enabling update mode detection and future template version migration

### Fixed

- Aligned env var names across all skills: renamed `REPO_API_TOKEN` → `API_TOKEN_ENV_VAR` and `REVIEW_API_TOKEN` → `REVIEW_TOKEN_ENV_VAR` so that `.env.example`, `init` skill validation, and all operational skill prerequisites use consistent names
- `init` Step 4 guidance now lists `REVIEW_TOKEN_ENV_VAR` alongside `API_TOKEN_ENV_VAR`
- `.env.example` comment for `REVIEW_TOKEN_ENV_VAR` now clarifies it is consumed by the `code-review` skill
- Fixed misleading "Installing a specific version" instructions in README that caused a `Marketplace file not found` error when using a relative local path; instructions now require an absolute path
- Fixed stale `§ Infrastructure` → `§ Local Development` cross-reference in `TEST-MATRIX.md` template
- Fixed stale `testing-2.md` → `testing-prd` skill name reference in `PRD-MANIFEST.md` template
- Removed inert `pw-version` stamps from `templates/PROJECT.md` and `templates/REVIEW-CRITERIA.md` (these templates are reference-only; stamps are only meaningful in generated config files)

## [1.0.0] - 2026-03-25

### Added

- `init` skill — scaffolds project configuration files (PROJECT.md, REVIEW-CRITERIA.md, TEST-MATRIX.md, PRD-MANIFEST.md, .env.example)

- `gitea-api` reference skill — Gitea REST API operations (PRs, issues, comments, branches)
- `bug-fix` shared sub-agent — reusable bug-fix workflow
- GitLab CI pipeline — validates plugin structure and skill frontmatter on changes
- GitHub Actions workflow — mirrors GitLab CI validation for GitHub-hosted mirrors
